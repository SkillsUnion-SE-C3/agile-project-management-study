### A brief history of software development processes
<br />

Before 1968, there were no certified software specialists. Physicists and accountants etc. would take coding lessons to develop what was necessary to build their own systems. As the complexity of these systems grew, Software Engineering emerged as a discipline in it’s own right. This created a gap between the business or domain experts and developers and created a need for a more methodical approach to software development.

[Waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) is one of the first, if not the first, software development process models. The first formal detailed diagram of this process was released in 1970 and it describes a breakdown of project activities into linear sequential phases, where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous, so the progress flows downwards like a waterfall.

A great deal of time was given to planning and design which produced detailed documentation. This documentation became the foundation for the coding process, after which the application was tested and then it was released to users and moved to maintenance phase.

This process was not invented but rather inherited from other industries like manufacturing and construction. A software project was approached in a similar fashion as building a bridge. 
The finished product reached the hands of users at the very end of the process which may have taken years or in extreme cases, decades.

During that time requirements, systems, and even entire businesses were likely to change. Moreover, technologies themselves are in constant change and what may have been the up and coming piece of tech may not be supported a few years down the line.

Many projects ended up being cancelled partway through, and many of those that were completed didn't meet the current needs of the business. In 1990’s the industry faced an “application delivery lag”. It was estimated that the time between a validated business need and an actual application in production was about three years. 
As the world kept accelerating and software being an inherently different kind of entity where knowledge gained from the development process itself can feed back to the requirements and design of the solution, companies realised they needed to be more nimble. 

The software industry, advocates believed, was too focused on process and planning — to the detriment of the product and customer. Even in 70’s, there was already a general awareness of the need for iteration and lightweight processes.

As an alternative, [Rapid Application Development process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development) was developed which emphasises the use of software and user feedback over strict planning and requirements recording. These ideas of dividing work into smaller sections, working in quick iterations while prioritising fast feedback were drivers of modern software development processes and workflows.

## Questions

1. Please give 2 benefits and 2 drawbacks to Waterfall method

    ```
   Benefits:
        Time spent early in the software production cycle can reduce costs at later stages
        waterfall model places emphasis on documentation

   Drawbacks:
        Clients may not know exactly what their requirements are before they see working software and so change their requirements, leading to redesign, redevelopment, and retesting, and increased costs
         Designers may not be aware of future difficulties when designing a new software product or feature
